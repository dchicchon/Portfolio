# Portfolio

## Summary

A website to display my projects and some info about myself

## CLI

I generated my project list by adding this config to a project's package.json.

```
 "reactProject": {
    "ready": true,
    "entry": "./src/index.jsx"
  },
```

In addition to this, I had to format my projects to ensure that they were able to "fit" into the React context of my portfolio.

## TODO

- update home page sketch to grow lines/move dot rather than instantaneously make lines
- figure out how to get projects to map `node_modules` to their own directories rather than having to download them in this directory
- add descriptions for my projects
- give my projects better names
